				<h2>My Babiloves</h2>
				<p>I will introduce my one and only best boyfriend; his name is Aldwin.
				 I call him Adi when he is my suitor at that time, Adi is short for Aldwin, but when he became my boyfriend, I call him now my babi, babiloves or mahal kong babi.</p>
				 <p>My baby is annoying sometimes because most of the time he is so dense and does not lambing to me when I am irritated with him.</p>
				 <p>He is calm most of the time, but sensitive like me with other things. 
				 We are so different in many aspects and have different points of view, but we also understand each other most of the time.</p>  
				 <p>He always spoils me when it comes to food; he always buys me the food I crave and makes the effort to see me. And napaka kuripot nya when it comes to his self.
				 My baby is so sweet and so dorky most of the time, He is unique and no one can be better than him.</p>
				 <p>I love him always.</p>

	<section id="why">
		<h1 class="heading">Why I Love Him</h1>
		<p>We first met at the church, and he said that he fell in love at first sight with me. After a month of talking, he decided to court me, and after three months of courting, I officially accepted him as my boyfriend. I fell in love with him because I felt at peace with him. No words can describe why I love him. As the days go by, I love him more and more.</p>
		<p> We have misunderstandings most of the time, but when we cool down, we talk about them and how to solve them. He has no other friend like Tropa with whom he can drink alcohol, so I don't have so much to overthink about. He always listens to me and my point of view; that's his one quality that I love.</p>
		<p> I love how he looks, how he smiles, how he talks, and I love his personality, even if we have misunderstandings most of the time. He is perfect for me; I love all of him, even though he has flaws and battles he doesn't talk about. I want to be a better girlfriend for him and for our future. He is the one who cheers me on and supports me when I have struggles. I'm so blessed and thankful at the same time that God gave him to me. I think he first loved me, but I fell harder for him.</p>

		<h1 class="headings">His Love Language</h1>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="box">
				<h1 class="headings">Physical Touch</h1>
				<p>His number one love language is physical touch; he loves hugs and kisses, and so do I. He is a clingy type of person and always wants a kiss and a hug from me. As for me, I don't mind it, but I love to give him a hundred or more hugs and kisses every time. That is how much more I love to be intimate with him, and still, I can't get enough. His touch can melt me and make me blush. Just his hug can make me calm and give me the comfort I need. He is my comfort person, my boyfriend, whom I love so much.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h1 class="headings">Words Of Affirmation</h1>
				<p>My baby loves to hear "I love you" every time, even if he doesn't do anything for me, like gift me something or give me something in return for the words "I love you." As for me, I'd like to say I love him every time and every day, even if we have a fight or misunderstanding. He loves to hear me assure him that I'd choose him always and not give up on him for the worst days that come. I'd rather fight for him always than lose him forever.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="box">
				<h1 class="headings">Quality Time</h1>
				<p>Beside physical touch, his other love language is quality time. Unlike me, the best quality time for me is to bond with him and do an activity together. But for him, his quality time is just a rest, but with me. Just a nap or sleeping while we cuddle, and that is enough for him. And aside from just rest, he loves to talk heart to heart about everything, our points of view, our sensitivity, and other things. He especially loves to hear me talk about my opinion and my point of view. He is just a simple boyfriend who wants a true partner who can help him be better, but for me, he is so special and perfect in all aspects.
